Fancy targets for Call of Life "Laser" guns

Also sold under "Legacy Toys" with several knock-offs, this gun-only laser tag uses IR with sensors in the gun.  No vests.  The guns are lightweight and easy to handle for kids, but inevitably two wind up toe to toe yelling at each other.  Giving them a different goal, or at least another target, avoids some of the negatives.
